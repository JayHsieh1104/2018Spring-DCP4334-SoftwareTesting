## Path Testing
### 1. C0: Statement Coverage
1. C0 is subsumed by Gnode metric
   * the program graphs allows statement fragments to be individual nodes
2. Statement is the minimum

* Example for **Triangle Problem**

| Case | a | b | c | Expected Output |
| ---- | - | - | - | --------------- |
| 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | Not a triangle |
| 2 | 5 | 5 | 5 | Equilateral |
| 3 | 5 | 5 | 1 | Isosceles |
| 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | Scalene |

* Example for **Nextdate Problem**

| Case | Year | Month | Day | Expected Output |
| ---- | - | - | - | --------------- |
| 1 | 2000 | 1 | 1 | 2000/1/2 |
| 2 | 1811 | 1 | 1 | Invalid Input |


* Example for **Commission Problem**

| Case | Lock | Stock | Barrel | Expected Output |
| ---- | - | - | - | --------------- |
| 1 | 0 | 10 | 10 | -1 |
| 2 | 35 | 40 | 45 | 640 |

### 2. C1: DD-Path coverage
1.  When every DD-path is traversed (C1 metric), each predicate outcome has been executed
    * traverse every edge in the DD-path graph
    * C1 is Gchain
 
* Example for **Triangle Problem**

| Case | a | b | c | Expected Output |
| ---- | - | - | - | --------------- |
| 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | Not a triangle |
| 2 | 5 | 5 | 5 | Equilateral |
| 3 | 5 | 5 | 1 | Isosceles |
| 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | Scalene |
| 5 | 5 | 5 | 0 | Invalid Input |

* Example for **Nextdate Problem**

| Case | Year | Month | Day | Expected Output |
| ---- | - | - | - | --------------- |
| 1 | 2000 | 11 | 29 | 2000/11/30 |
| 2 | 2000 | 11 | 30 | 2000/12/1 |
| 3 | 2000 | 12 | 31 | 2001/1/1 |
| 4 | 1811 | 1 | 1 | Invalid Input |

* Example for **Commission Problem**

| Case | Lock | Stock | Barrel | Expected Output |
| ---- | - | - | - | --------------- |
| 1 | 0 | 10 | 10 | -1 |
| 2 | 20 | 20 | 12 | 220 |
| 3 | 69 | 79 | 89 | 1400 |

### 3. C2: Simple Loop Coverage
1. C2 metric
   * DD-Path coverage (C1 metric) plus loop testing
2. Every loop involves a decision
   * one is to traverse the loop
   * one is to exit the loop (or not enter)
3. C2 metic is Gege test coverage
 
* Example for **Triangle Problem**

| Case | a | b | c | Expected Output |
| ---- | - | - | - | --------------- |
| 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | Not a triangle |
| 2 | 5 | 5 | 5 | Equilateral |
| 3 | 5 | 5 | 1 | Isosceles |
| 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | Scalene |
| 5 | 5 | 5 | 0 | Invalid Input |

* Example for **Nextdate Problem**

| Case | Year | Month | Day | Expected Output |
| ---- | ---- | ----- | --- | --------------- |
| 1 | 2000 | 11 | 29 | 2000/11/30 |
| 2 | 2000 | 11 | 30 | 2000/12/1 |
| 3 | 2000 | 12 | 31 | 2001/1/1 |
| 4 | 1811 | 1 | 1 | Invalid Input |

| 3 | 20 | 20 | 12 | 220 |
| 4 | 69 | 79 | 89 | 1400 |

## Modified Condition Decision Coverage(MCDC)
1. Every statement must be executed at least once
2. Every program entry point and exit point must be invoked at least once
3. All possible outcomes of every control statement are taken at least once
4. Every nonconstant Boolean expression has been evaluated to both true and false outcomes
5. Every nonconstant condition in a Boolean expression has been evaluated to both true and false outcomes
6. Every nonconstant condition in a Boolean expression has been shown to independently affect the outcomes (of the expression)
